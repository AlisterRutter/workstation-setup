# workstation-setup
Lite scripts to setup a workstation

IMPORTANT: Run the scripts from this folder, there are plenty of relative paths in the bash scripts that will break if you don't.

Prerequisites:

- Working internet connection
- Administrator account, for sudo requests
- Setup an SSH Key and attach it to your Github account

To install everything in a logical order:

`install-all.sh`

If something fails, sorry, you will probably have to re-run individual scripts and do some debugging.

Please make sure to push fixes back upstream!
